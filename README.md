AI-Powered Testing with Playwright & Gen AI

This project demonstrates how to perform end-to-end browser automation using Generative AI and AI Agents integrated with Playwright. Instead of writing traditional code, testers can use simple English instructions to enter data, click buttons and validate results. The AI interprets commands like "Enter 'username' in username field" and executes them directly in the browser. It supports interaction with inputs, checkboxes and buttons.

The automation framework is powered by ZeroStep AI, which was configured to interpret plain English test steps and convert them into executable actions using Playwright. AI functions were embedded in the test config to handle data entry and validations without manual scripting. This approach is ideal for QA teams aiming to scale automation quickly using AI-first strategies.
